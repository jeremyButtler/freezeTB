  Abstract={
    Alaska has the highest incidence of tuberculosis (TB)
    in the United States, with 8% mortality while
    undergoing TB treatment. With a quarter of TB cases
    lacking sputum culture to enable drug resistance
    testing, FreezeTB aimed to develop tools tailored to
    meet the challenges in Alaska while being
    translatable to other settings. We designed a rapid
    and cost-effective laboratory workflow and software
    to identify drug-resistant mutations in Mycobacterium
    tuberculosis using targeted next-generation
    sequencing (tNGS). FreezeTB, a Fast, Reliable,
    Economical Evaluation tool to Zap Endemic
    Tuberculosis, amplifies 22 gene loci associated with
    resistance to 16 anti-tuberculosis drugs. M.
    tuberculosis isolates from Alaska (2011-2024) were
    blinded and underwent analysis with FreezeTB, then
    compared with phenotypic drug susceptibility testing
    (pDST) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Compared
    with WGS (n = 79), FreezeTB provided the same
    mutations in 96% (n = 76/79) of samples with 100%
    lineage agreement (n = 79/79). Compared with pDST
    using Cohen's kappa, FreezeTB had almost perfect
    agreement for rifampin (RIF, 0.90; n = 97/98) and
    ethambutol (EMB, 1.00; n = 98/98), strong agreement
    for isoniazid (INH, 0.80; n = 88/98), moderate
    agreement for ethionamide (ETO, 0.78; n = 95/98),
    weak agreement for streptomycin (STR, 0.56; n =
    95/98), and no agreement for pyrazinamide (PZA, 0.20;
    n = 91/98). Using a portable nanopore sequencer, each
    sample cost under $30 for sequencing, which included
    a flow cell, a barcoding kit, a flow cell wash kit, a
    polymerase, and primers. FreezeTB provides a
    portable, 1-day laboratory and bioinformatic workflow
    for sequencing M. tuberculosis. Freeze TB can
    accurately determine mycobacterial lineage and
    resistance for RIF, INH, ETH, and ETO at a low
    cost.IMPORTANCEGlobally, tuberculosis is the leading
    infectious cause of mortality with 10.8 million new
    cases and 1.25 million deaths occurring in 2024.
    Targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) is a
    rapid, cost-effective method for identifying
    mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome
    associated with drug resistance. FreezeTB was created
    to provide low-cost, portable sequencing and tNGS
    analysis for drug resistance. FreezeTB selectively
    amplifies and sequences 24 targets of the M.
    tuberculosis genome that cover regions the WHO has
    designated as containing mutations conferring drug
    resistance, as well as provides species confirmation
    and rapid lineage determination. Freeze TB is a
    laboratory workflow and free, open-source (OS) low
    dependency bioinformatic software that can be
    downloaded onto a computer with no further need for
    internet access. Using M. tuberculosis isolates from
    Alaska, FreezeTB provided the same mutations in 96%
    (n = 76/79) of samples with 100% lineage agreement (n
    = 79/79) compared with whole genome sequencing.

  Abstract={
    MOTIVATION: Recent advances in sequencing
    technologies promise ultra-long reads of âˆ¼100 kb in
    average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high
    throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in length.
    Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient
    to process such data at scale, which presses for the
    development of new alignment algorithms. RESULTS:
    Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to
    map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large
    reference database. It works with accurate short
    reads of â‰¥100â€‰bp in length, â‰¥1â€‰kb genomic
    reads at error rate âˆ¼15%, full-length noisy Direct
    RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely
    related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in
    length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs
    concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions
    and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious
    alignments. It is 3-4 times as fast as mainstream
    short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is â‰
    30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA
    mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners
    specialized in one type of alignment. AVAILABILITY
    AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/lh3/minimap2.

    SUMMARY: We present several recent improvements to
    minimap2, a versatile pairwise aligner for nucleotide
    sequences. Now minimap2 v2.22 can more accurately map
    long reads to highly repetitive regions and align
    through insertions or deletions up to 100â€‰kb by
    default, addressing major weakness in minimap2 v2.18
    or earlier. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
