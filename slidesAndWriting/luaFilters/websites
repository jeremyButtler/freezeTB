1. Writing abstracts in text
   - https://github.com/pandoc-ext/abstract-section
2. Separate reference sections for each chapter
   - Not useful for this project, but would have been
     useful for my thesis.

3. Convert \newpage to line break in docx
   - https://github.com/pandoc-ext/pagebreak
4. Remove https:// from urls
   - You could do this by hand, but sometimes it is nice
     to have a filter.

5. Many lua filters
   - https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters
   - Includes author-meta-blocks
   - Includes pagebreak
   - scholarly-metadata
   - Includes abstract-to-meta (needs scholarly metadata)
