  Abstract={
    BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to
    anti-tuberculosis drugs is a major threat to global
    public health. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is
    rapidly gaining traction as a diagnostic tool for
    clinical tuberculosis settings. To support this
    informatically, previous work led to the development
    of the widely used TBProfiler webtool, which predicts
    resistance to 14 drugs from WGS data. However, for
    accurate and rapid high throughput of samples in
    clinical or epidemiological settings, there is a need
    for a stand-alone tool and the ability to analyse
    data across multiple WGS platforms, including Oxford
    Nanopore MinION. RESULTS: We present a new command
    line version of the TBProfiler webserver, which
    includes hetero-resistance calling and will
    facilitate the batch processing of samples. The
    TBProfiler database has been expanded to incorporate
    178 new markers across 16 anti-tuberculosis drugs.
    The predictive performance of the mutation library
    has been assessed using > 17,000 clinical isolates
    with WGS and laboratory-based drug susceptibility
    testing (DST) data. An integrated MinION analysis
    pipeline was assessed by performing WGS on 34
    replicates across 3 multi-drug resistant isolates
    with known resistance mutations. TBProfiler accuracy
    varied by individual drug. Assuming DST as the gold
    standard, sensitivities for detecting
    multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively
    drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) were 94% (95%CI 93-95%)
    and 83% (95%CI 79-87%) with specificities of 98%
    (95%CI 98-99%) and 96% (95%CI 95-97%) respectively.
    Using MinION data, only one resistance mutation was
    missed by TBProfiler, involving an insertion in the
    tlyA gene coding for capreomycin resistance. When
    compared to alternative platforms (e.g. Mykrobe
    predictor TB, the CRyPTIC library), TBProfiler
    demonstrated superior predictive performance across
    first- and second-line drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The new
    version of TBProfiler can rapidly and accurately
    predict anti-TB drug resistance profiles across large
    numbers of samples with WGS data. The computing
    architecture allows for the ability to modify the
    core bioinformatic pipelines and outputs, including
    the analysis of WGS data sourced from portable
    technologies. TBProfiler has the potential to be
    integrated into the point of care and WGS diagnostic
    environments, including in resource-poor settings.

    SUMMARY: Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive
    unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing
    is widely used to genotype Mycobacterium tuberculosis
    complex in epidemiological studies for tracking
    tuberculosis transmission. Recent long-read
    sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and
    Oxford Nanopore Technologies can produce reads that
    are long enough to cover the entire repeat regions in
    each MIRU-VNTR locus which was previously not
    possible using the short reads from Illumina
    high-throughput sequencing technologies. We thus
    developed MIRUReader for MIRU-VNTR typing directly
    from long sequence reads. AVAILABILITY AND

  Abstract={
    MOTIVATION: Recent advances in sequencing
    technologies promise ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in
    average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high
    throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in length.
    Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient
    to process such data at scale, which presses for the
    development of new alignment algorithms. RESULTS:
    Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to
    map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large
    reference database. It works with accurate short
    reads of ≥100 bp in length, ≥1 kb genomic
    reads at error rate ∼15%, full-length noisy Direct
    RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely
    related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in
    length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs
    concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions
    and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious
    alignments. It is 3-4 times as fast as mainstream
    short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is
    ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA
    mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners
    specialized in one type of alignment. AVAILABILITY
    AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/lh3/minimap2.

    available at Bioinformatics online.

  Abstract={
    How viruses evolve within hosts can dictate infection
    outcomes; however, reconstructing this process is
    challenging. We evaluate our multiplexed amplicon
    approach, PrimalSeq, to demonstrate how virus
    concentration, sequencing coverage, primer
    mismatches, and replicates influence the accuracy of
    measuring intrahost virus diversity. We develop an
    experimental protocol and computational tool, iVar,
    for using PrimalSeq to measure virus diversity using
    Illumina and compare the results to Oxford Nanopore
    sequencing. We demonstrate the utility of PrimalSeq
    by measuring Zika and West Nile virus diversity from
    varied sample types and show that the accumulation of
    genetic diversity is influenced by experimental and
    biological systems.
