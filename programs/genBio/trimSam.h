| Fun01: seq_trimSam
| Use:
|  - Trims off the soft masked regions of a sam entry
| Input:
|  - samVoidST:
|    o samEntry struct with sam entry to trim. Named
|      void so I can cast it as a samEntry to samST
| Output:
|  - Returns:
|    o 0 if suceeded
|    o def_header_trimSam if header (invalid and ignored)
|    o def_noMap_trimSam if unmapped read (no reference)
|    o def_noSeq_trimSam if no sequence line
|  - Modifies:
|    o Trims cigar, sequence, & q-score entries in samST.

| Fun02: coords_trimSam
|   - Trim an sam file entry by coordinates
| Input:

|     o Pointer to an sam entry structure with an read to
|       trim
|   - startSI:
|     o Singed integer with the starting coordinate
|   - endSI:
|     o Singed integer with the ending coordinate
|     o < 1 is treated as do not trim
| Output:
|   - Modifies:
|     o samSTPtr to be trimmed
|   - Returns:
|     o 0 for no errors
|     o 1 for coordinates out of range

|       trim
|   - startSI:
|     o number bases to trim off the start of the read

|     o number bases to trim off the end of the read
|   - strictBl:
|     o 3: trim extactly only both ends
|     o 2: trim extactly endSI bases (end only)
|     o 1: trim extactly startSI bases (start only)
|     o 0: trim at until match is found after startSI and
|          endSI
| Output:
|   - Modifies:
|     o seqSTPtr, qStr, cigTypeStr, and cigArySI in

| Fun04: trimReads_trimSam
| Use:
|  - Goes though sam file and calls seq_trimSam for each

| Input:

|  - outFILE:
|    o File to write the trimmed sam file entries to
|  - keepUmapBl:

|  - Prints:
