| Fun01: samCigToEqxCig 
|   - convert an sam entry cigar to an eqx cigar
| Input:
|   - samSTPtr:
|     o pointer to an samEntry struct to convert cigar
|       into an eqx cigar entry
|   - refStr:
|     o pointer to an reference sequence to use in the
|       conversion
|   - strBuffPtr:
|     o pointer to an c-string buffer to hold the cigar
|       entry temporarly
|   - valArySI:
|     o pointer to an int array to hold the cigar
|       entry temporarly
|   - lenBuffSI:
|     o pointer to current length of strBuffPtr and
|       valArySI
|   - nAsSnpSC:
|     o 1: Treat anymous bases as SNPs always
|     o 0: Treat annoymous bases as matches, if they match
| Output:
|   - Modifies:
|     o cigTypeStr in samSTPtr to be an eqx entry
|     o cigValAryI in samSTPtr to have counts for the
|       eqx entry
|     o strBuffPtr to be larger if needed
|     o valArySI to be larger if needed
|     o lenBuffSI to hold new buffer size if needed
|   - Returns:
|     o 0 for success
|     o 1 for memory error
|       - does not free strBuffPtr (you need to free)
|       - does not free valArySI   (you need to free)
|     o 2 if read had no sequence
